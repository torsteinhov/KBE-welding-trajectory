# KBE-welding-trajectory
In this final assignment we were challenged with producing a program that automated CAD-design of welding lines. More specifically, the walls of a maze was supposed to be welded to a base plane. This was made possible by programming the geometric calculations and running the program in Journal, a function in Siemens NX. We also made a more independent program that takes in 2D images of the maze and generates images in 2D of the welding lines. KBE was in focus for capture and systematically reuse of engineering knowledge, with the final goal of reducing time and costs of repetitive product development tasks. We have learned plenty from the previous assignments which came to good use in this last iteration. Agreeing early on the geometric, constantly thinking scalability and striving for generalisation are just examples of how the previous iterations has made us better KBE engineers.
